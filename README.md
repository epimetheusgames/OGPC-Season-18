## Game Summary

It's a diving game.

## Technical Requirements & Information:

- We are using [Godot 4,3](https://godotengine.org/), which requires the machine to support the Vulkan graphics library. We will also export a Compatability version which uses [OpenGL 3.0](https://www.opengl.org/) (GLES3), which might have visual bugs/artifacts, but this will not be the official release.
- There will be an option for an efficiency mode so that the game can run on most mid-range and some low-range laptops ...
- This game is designed to be used with a keyboard and a mouse or a bluetooth/USB controller.
- Godot uses [GDscript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html), which is Godotâ€™s own programming language, along with GLSL for shaders (your typical screenspace shaders are a modified version of GLSL for Godot, and compute shaders which are used for things like boids are pure GLSL).
- We're using [Sibelius](https://www.avid.com/sibelius) for music, along with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).
- We're using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) for art.
